# Week 4 Practical

This week practical files are added in this folder.
This folder contains the following program.

1. Tan Integral - Area

Use GCC Compiler to compile and execute the code.

The code is complied and executed using VSCode on a mac machine.

To Run this Program in linux machine:

Compile using following command

    gcc TanIntegral_Area.c -o TanIntegral_Area.c -lm

    Print the Output using this command

    ./TanIntegral_Area.c

    (-lm is to map math library to the gcc)
This code does the same things as in practical03, except it uses a function to run the steps instead. The expected output is the area using the trapezoid rule, and the area using log(2)
