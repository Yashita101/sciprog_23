This week practical files are added in this folder.
This folder contains the following program.

1. Magic Square

Use GCC Compiler to compile and execute the code.

The code is complied and executed using VSCode on a mac machine.

To Run this Program in linux machine:

Compile using following command

    gcc main.c

    Enter the file name to receive the Output using this command

    ./a.out

This code will be run only if the header file is also accessible in the same directory as main.c The input matrix to be tested is stored in the "magic_square.txt" and "not_magic_square.txt" file.

Once the code runs, it will print the number of lines in the matrix, the matrix itself, the number of elements, the row and column sums and whether or not it is a Magic Square.
